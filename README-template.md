## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap


### What I learned

I learned whilst carrying out this challenge, if I wanted my card to be centered verically and horizontally, the best way to do this was to wrap the card inside a parent element, sized the parent at 100vh (full screen) and then begin the CSS to center the card.

### Useful resources

- [Responsive Design](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30460681/changing-image-src-depending-on-screen-size) - This helped me to change the images depending on which screen size was being used for viewing the product card.
